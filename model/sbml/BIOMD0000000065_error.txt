    FunctionDefinitionConverter: The document on which conversion is being requested is invalid and the requested conversion cannot be performed. This error is typically returned when a conversion routine has been given an invalid target document or the conversion requires a certain degree of validity that is not present in the document. To avoid this error, use the SBMLDocument::checkConsistency() function to find and resolve errors before passing the document to a conversion method. 
    InitialAssignmentConverter:  The operation was successful.
